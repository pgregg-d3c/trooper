  - "I'm sure glad I wasn't stationed here when Vader was alive. I heard he liked to use stormtroopers for lightsaber practice."
  - "I've seen some impressive things as a Stormtrooper of the Empire. I've seen Star Destroyers tear apart a battlecruiser with just tractor beams. I've seen command ships so big they take three days to walk from end to end. I even saw Lord Vader once. But I think the greatest thing I ever saw was those squat little dropships, flying out of a binary sunset, loaded with reinforcements, ammunition, medical droids and food."

  - "Hello citizen. I believe you were warned about coming back to this sector.. Am I right?"
  - "Didn’t we warn you to stay away from this sector?  Well, you got our attention? Are you trying to get arrested?"
